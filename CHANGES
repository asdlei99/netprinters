NetPrinters changelog

Version 2.1:
	Wrote new expression comparing function with support for a '#' wildcard
	which is the same as '?', except it only matches integers.
	
	Removed -a argument because it didn't have any useful information.
	Removed -e argument because it was only there for debugging anyway.
	
	Wrote ncase_match() function for case-insensitive string comparisons.

Version 2.0:
	Full rewrite of v1.x
